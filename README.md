# PatternRecognition_TeamTasks

Team tasks to lecture "Pattern Recognition" at University of Fribourg.

### Team 'Over9000'
- Livio Baetscher
- Carl Balmer
- Mathias Fuchs
- Manuela Haefliger
- Marc-Antoine Jacques

### Language
- Python 3.6.1

## Final Validation

The final validation of the three Exercises has been performed and the results can be found in the corresponding folder.

### Exercise 2

For the MNIST task, the MLP has been chosen over the SVM. The final validation of exercise 2 has been done in the file `Exercise_2b/validation.py` and the results can be found in the file `Exercise_2b/output.txt`.

### Exercise 3

### Exercise 4

The final validation of exercise 4 has been done in the file `Exercise_4/validation.py` and the results can be found in the file `Exercise_4/output.txt`.

## Content

Each exercise has its own folder and its own README file.
